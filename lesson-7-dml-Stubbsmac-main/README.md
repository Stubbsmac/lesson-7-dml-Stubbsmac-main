# CIS250_Create07_Data Definition Language (DDL)
For this assignment you will be using a jupyter notebook to learn about Data Definition Language, or DDL. We use DDL to create, alter, and drop database object. This week you will be working with two new sets of database tables that you will be creating, loading, editing, and deleting throughout the notebook. The ERDs for both of these datasets have been included in the repo. Instead of a set of exercises and a scenario this week you will be completing a scenario that is broken up into a series of smaller exercises to make it managable.

## If Something Goes Wrong
Please contact your instructor if something goes wrong. Since we are doing exercises that effect the integrity of the data in your databases there may be operations that you are not able to undo. If you delete or alter data in your database in an unintended way, please reach out as soon as you possible.

## Before Starting
1. Ensure that you have completed the practice assignment succesfully.
2. Complete the Practice Jupyter Notebook assignment.
3. Complete the Module 5 and 6 Create Assignments

## Assignment Description
* The scenario will guide you through creating, loading, altering, using, and dropping a set of database tables
* Each of these tasks are broken up into an individual exercise

## Assignment Requirements
* You must write all of your scripts in the Create file and check it into github
* For full credit your scripts must return the requested result exactly
* You must use best practices in your scripts. Proper casing, spacing, and formatting are required.
* Your submitted file should show that you have -- ran -- the scripts that you are submitting.

## Tips
* Always include a WHERE condition when updateing and deleting data.
* You do not need to put a comma between an attribute name and a datatype in a CREATE statement, just a space.
* Pay careful attention to the structure of Transaction scripts.
* If you get stuck, make a post in the Homework Help channel in Teams.
